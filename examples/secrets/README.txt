This directory contains a game, called Secrets of the Rime, implemented as part of
the following Master's Thesis at WPI by Philip Hanson, submitted June, 2010.

	A Unified Representation for Dialogue and Action in Computer Games: 
	Bridging the Gap Between Talkers and Fighters

The full thesis can be downloaded at http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-052710-114241.

The implementation uses the Golden T game engine (see http://www.goldenstudios.or.id/products/GTGE) 
and Disco for Games (see http://www.cs.wpi.edu/~rich/d4g).

To run precompiled version from current location with disco project installed at same level:   

		java -jar secrets.jar
		
Otherwise, make sure that disco/disco.jar and disco/d4g/golden_0_2_3.jar are on the classpath.
