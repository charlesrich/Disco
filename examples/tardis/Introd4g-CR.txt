** CR DESIGN COMMENTS 10/17

Disco sketch for Phase 2 of the Tardis Scenario
Oct 17, 2012

General variables:
** Assuming for now these are Javascript variables, but if it turns out
   they already (or need to) be created and updated in Java, then
   you can access them easily as static variables of a Java class, e.g.,
   as Packages.my.package.MyClass.USER_PERSONALITY

userPersonality--a list with a bunch of adjectives to describe user from parts of the dialog
** You need to figure out exactly how you want to represent this.  E.g., there are no
   lists, per se, in Javascript, but you can use Java collections, etc., ect.  It depends
   how you want to use this information.  You could indeed just concatenate onto a string and
   use Javascript indexOf, e.g.,

   userPersonality.indexOf("desperate") >= 0

   To concatenate onto string, e.g,

   var userPersonality = ""
   userPersonality +=" desperate"

agentPersonality--DH (dominant, hostile) or DF (dominant, friendly)
** string "DH" or "DF"

agentFrustration--numerical values; starts at 1.

task Introduction 
 subtask Normal
  step IntroSelf
  step LocateCompany
  step ApplyJob
  step Essentialjobqualities
  step GoodCandidate
 endsubtask
endtask

DTREE: 
  agent id= IntroSelf  text=self.intro  
  	[DF:  I would like to start by asking you to introduce yourself, tell me how you 
	found our company and why you have applied for this job;  DH: me how you found
	 our company and why you applied for the job. ]
    user text = I have been working for the past while as a {position} but now I'm unemployed.  I need a job.

** using eval="..." to update counters below; good!

   	       Agentfrustration=agentfrustration + .5

** watch for bugs in inconsistent capitalization, e.g., Agentfrustration vs. agentFrustration
** stick with one convention!

               userPersonality= userPersonality ++ "desparate"

** desperate [sp] watch out!  Can lead to bugs!

    user text = I have been employed up til now as a {position}.  I saw your advertisement and 
                  looked up your company. I thought my skills matched well with your company.
	       locateCompany = T

** see Javascript note above [ditto re inconsistent capitalization!]

	       Userpersonality= userPersonality ++ "motivated"

    user text = Well, I haven't ever had a job, but I'd like to work for you.

  ;;; note that the second two user choices don't change the agent frustration level.  But you might want 
      to do that!
statements in [] are meant to be put in .translate files for each kind of agent.

Dtrees can't have postconditions (just preconditions).  So I have to add a layer of structure for LocateCompany as follows:

task LocateCompany
   subtask abletolocate
    applicability locateCompany==false
    step Locate
   endsubtask
endtask

** task above not needed.  Just make LocateCompany step in Normal
   optional (minOccurs="0") and rename id below to "LocateCompany"
   and add precondition per below

DTREE
  agent id=Locate
	text = how.foundus  [DF:Could you please tell me how you found our company and why you have 
	applied for this job?  DH:Tell me how you found this company.  Why did you apply?]

** add precondition="locateCompany"  
** I think you mean the true condition??  [ Btw, note x==false is same as !x ]

   user text= I really needed a job and I saw your advertisement.  You office is near my place so I applied.
   	agentFrustration=agentfrustration + .5
   user text = The position your company advertised fits my skill set.  And your company has a mission that I am interested in.
       	agentFrustration=agentfrustration - .5
        userPersonality= userPersonality ++ "motivated"
	applyJob = true
   user text= I found out about your company in the newspaper.  I looked up {company name} on the web.  I was impressed by your mission statement. 
       	agentFrustration=agentfrustration - .5
        userPersonality= userPersonality ++ "motivated"
	applyJob = true

;;;need substructure for using applicablity condition here too.

** no you don't.  Ditto above

Task ApplyJob
  Subtask whyapply
  	  applicability agentPersonality==DF or applyJob==false
  step WhyThisJob
  end subtask
end task

DTREE
  agent id=WhyThisJob
	text = why.apply  [DF: Can you tell me how your skills relate to the position? DH:<no statement>]
   user text = I think I can do this job.  It's like my last one.
       Agentfrustration=agentfrustration + .5
   user text = I am basically organized and hard working.  I learn fast. I can use those skills.
   user text = My previous job as a {position} taught me skills I can use in this position.

** note capitalization issues again

DTREE
  agent id=EssentialJobQualities
  	text = essential.qualities [DF: In your opinion, what are the essential qualities for this job?
	       DH:  what are the essential qualities for this job?]
   user text = I think that I will need to be efficient and well organized.
        agentFrustration=agentfrustration + .5
	do task=try2essential
   user text = Efficient, well organized, mission focused and ready to learn new skills.
   user text = Being ready to learn whatever I can.

** why are you breaking try2essential out (with a 'do') rather than just
   nesting it inline?  I think nesting would be clearer and easier to follow.

DTREE
  agent id=try2essential
  	 text= try2essential.qualities  [DF:  Can you think of other qualities? DH: what else?]
 	 precondition frustration <= 2
   user text = Be polite.
     	      Agentfrustration=agentfrustration + .5	      
   user text = Be willing to learn.
   user text = Be willing to ask for help.

DTREE
  agent id=GoodCandidate 
  	text = why.good [DF:Can you tell me why you think you are a good candidate for this job? 
	       DH: so why are you are good for this job?]
   user text= I am usually well organized and nice with people so I think I can perform well in
             this job. In addition, I have experience of doing this type of job.
       	           Agentfrustration=agentfrustration + .5	      
   user text = I have learned the basic skill set for this job, and I want to learn more.  I can contribute 
       	    to the company's goals because I'm a hard worker and get on with other people.
   user text = I'm polite and hard working. My last job is similar to this one.
       	           Agentfrustration=agentfrustration + .5
