 <!-- this is a library to teach a person the purpose of a resume and how to make one.  
      The agent asks a lot of questions and for some, the user would need to type answers
      into a keyboard because it is not possible to load menus for all the answers.
	  
 -->

<!--
      Start with a MakeResume task that consists of Greeting, WhatResumeIs, BasicResume, Closing.
	  Idea is that the WhatResumeIs explains why there is a resume and what goes into it.  
	  BasicResume constructs a data structure that goes in a User profile that contains 
	  the parts of a resume:  name and address, education, work experience, relevant work 
	  skills, work statement.  All of these parts will have to come from the user.
