      Basic idea: 4 step plan of an _Opening, _Who_To_See, _Applicant_Name, _Interview_Person, _Closing.

Opening, Who_To_See, Applicant_Name, and Closing are just d4g trees.

 <!-- Talking about interests:

   Can you tell me what you most liked that you learned in school?

       I really liked : digital media, math, languages, science, wood shop, cooking, computer technology.
         Store this info in a user model?
       agent response:  depending on the interviewer, some of these will be more pertinent.  Suppose interviewer is from a company that does digital media.  Then digital media, math and computer technology responses would be relevant and might lead to a followup question such as:  (for digital media), what sort of projects did you do?  Or, I see that your resume says you built your own website.  (for computer technology) Did you do project in computer technology for (whatever-not sure what to ask here).  (For math) did you complete math through calculus?


    You haven't any work record.  
    Have you done any unpaid work?
       yes, I've done work for some friends and family.
       no, nothing.

    You have some work record.  
    Did you do work after school or in the summer?  
       after school.
       in the summer.
       both after school and in the summer.  
    Good, that means you do know how to hold a job!
