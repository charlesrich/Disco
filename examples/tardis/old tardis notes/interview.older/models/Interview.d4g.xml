  <!-- Language-specific part of interview dialog.
       See InterviewTop.xml for toplevel goals.
       See Coach for coaching dialog
 
       NOTE: This dialogue begins with a receptionist, which really 
       should be a separate character, but is not modelled here.
       However, this is much easier than the coach and interviewer 
       coordination.   We simply start with the receptionist and then
       have an action which changes to the interviewer.  -CR
