This folder contains XML schemas for the three namespaces used in
Disco and D4g, in both RNC and XSD formats.  Use these schemas for
convenient editing of task model files in a schema-based XML editor
such as Emacs (see ../schemas.xml) or one of the many other
schema-based editors available, from the free low-end, e.g., XML
Notepad, to the high end, e.g., XMLSpy.
