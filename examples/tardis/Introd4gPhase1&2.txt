 Disco sketch for Phase 2 of the Tardis Scenario
Oct 17, 2012

General variables:

userPersonality--a list with a bunch of adjectives to describe user from parts of the dialog
agentPersonality--DH (dominant, hostile) or DF (dominant, friendly)
agentFrustration--numerical values; starts at 1.

task Introduction 
 subtask Normal
  step IntroSelf
  step LocateCompany
  step ApplyJob
  step Essentialjobqualities
  step GoodCandidate
 endsubtask
endtask

DTREE: 
  agent id= IntroSelf  text=self.intro  
  	[DF:  I would like to start by asking you to introduce yourself, tell me how you 
	found our company and why you have applied for this job;  DH: me how you found
	 our company and why you applied for the job. ]
    user text = I have been working for the past while as a {position} but now I'm unemployed.  I need a job.
   	       Agentfrustration=agentfrustration + .5
               userPersonality= userPersonality ++ "desparate"
    user text = I have been employed up til now as a {position}.  I saw your advertisement and 
                  looked up your company. I thought my skills matched well with your company.
	       locateCompany = T
	       Userpersonality= userPersonality ++ "motivated"
    user text = Well, I haven't ever had a job, but I'd like to work for you.

  ;;; note that the second two user choices don't change the agent frustration level.  But you might want 
      to do that!
statements in [] are meant to be put in .translate files for each kind of agent.

Dtrees can't have postconditions (just preconditions).  So I have to add a layer of structure for LocateCompany as follows:

task LocateCompany
   subtask abletolocate
    applicability locateCompany==false
    step Locate
   endsubtask
endtask

DTREE
  agent id=Locate
	text = how.foundus  [DF:Could you please tell me how you found our company and why you have 
	applied for this job?  DH:Tell me how you found this company.  Why did you apply?]
   user text= I really needed a job and I saw your advertisement.  You office is near my place so I applied.
   	agentFrustration=agentfrustration + .5
   user text = The position your company advertised fits my skill set.  And your company has a mission that I am interested in.
       	agentFrustration=agentfrustration - .5
        userPersonality= userPersonality ++ "motivated"
	applyJob = true
   user text= I found out about your company in the newspaper.  I looked up {company name} on the web.  I was impressed by your mission statement. 
       	agentFrustration=agentfrustration - .5
        userPersonality= userPersonality ++ "motivated"
	applyJob = true

;;;need substructure for using applicablity condition here too.

Task ApplyJob
  Subtask whyapply
  	  applicability agentPersonality==DF or applyJob==false
  step WhyThisJob
  end subtask
end task

DTREE
  agent id=WhyThisJob
	text = why.apply  [DF: Can you tell me how your skills relate to the position? DH:<no statement>]
   user text = I think I can do this job.  It's like my last one.
       Agentfrustration=agentfrustration + .5
   user text = I am basically organized and hard working.  I learn fast. I can use those skills.
   user text = My previous job as a {position} taught me skills I can use in this position.


DTREE
  agent id=EssentialJobQualities
  	text = essential.qualities [DF: In your opinion, what are the essential qualities for this job?
	       DH:  what are the essential qualities for this job?]
   user text = I think that I will need to be efficient and well organized.
        agentFrustration=agentfrustration + .5
	do task=try2essential
   user text = Efficient, well organized, mission focused and ready to learn new skills.
   user text = Being ready to learn whatever I can.

DTREE
  agent id=try2essential
  	 text= try2essential.qualities  [DF:  Can you think of other qualities? DH: what else?]
 	 precondition frustration <= 2
   user text = Be polite.
     	      Agentfrustration=agentfrustration + .5	      
   user text = Be willing to learn.
   user text = Be willing to ask for help.

DTREE
  agent id=GoodCandidate 
  	text = why.good [DF:Can you tell me why you think you are a good candidate for this job? 
	       DH: so why are you are good for this job?]
   user text= I am usually well organized and nice with people so I think I can perform well in
             this job. In addition, I have experience of doing this type of job.
       	           Agentfrustration=agentfrustration + .5	      
   user text = I have learned the basic skill set for this job, and I want to learn more.  I can contribute 
       	    to the company's goals because I'm a hard worker and get on with other people.
   user text = I'm polite and hard working. My last job is similar to this one.
       	           Agentfrustration=agentfrustration + .5
