Comments on Example 2

You will note that nothing interesting gets said by the coach when the interviewee initially offers the greeting "hey."  That's because I have not written any dialogue for the coach to say.  Feel free to do so if you like!

Similarly for
    Interviewer says "Thank you."
interviewee&interviewer  > say
[1] Yeh.
[2] You are welcome.
  >> 1
    Interviewee says "Yeh."

The coach could interject when the interviewee says "yeh" but again I haven't done that.
