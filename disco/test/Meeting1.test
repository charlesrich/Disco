# This test file illustrates seven different interaction dialogues
# from the same task model, depending on the user and system
# initiative.  Think about how complex this would be to do with, for
# example, a state machine approach.

# First, with the default console turn-taking model, in which
# the user only gets to make one utterance per turn.  NB: this
# turn-taking model is not built into Disco; it is just the default
# for the console tool and can be changed (see below).
