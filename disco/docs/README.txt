This is the documentation directory for Disco.  

In addition to Javadoc API documentation, it various papers which
provide background.  (See also task/docs).  

If you are trying to learn how to use Disco for writing dialogues,
we recommend starting with the first two papers below (in this order).

   ../../task/docs/Rich2009.pdf:

C. Rich. Building task-based user interfaces with ANSI/CEA-2018.
IEEE Computer, 42(8):20--27, August 2009.

   RichSidner2012_IVA.pdf:
   
C. Rich and C. Sidner. Using Collaborative Discourse Theory to
Partially Automated Dialogue Tree Authoring. In 14th Int.
Conf. on Intelligent Virtual Agents, Santa Cruz, CA, Sept. 2012.

Note that the complete reference documentation for the ANSI-CEA
standard is included as ../../task/docs/CEA-2018.pdf.
      
The following papers provide additional technical background.
      
   RichLeshSidner2001_Collagen.pdf: 

C. Rich, C. Sidner, and N. Lesh. "Collagen: Applying collaborative
discourse theory to human-computer interaction." AI Magazine,
22(4):15--25, 2001.

Since Disco is based on the same underlying collaborative discourse
theory as Collagen, this paper is a useful reference.

   HansonRich2010_AIIDE.pdf:

P. Hanson and C. Rich. "A Modal Approach to Integrating Dialogue and
Action." Submitted to AIIDE 2010.

This paper describes Disco for Games (D4g), which is built on top
of Disco, and describes some aspects of Disco along the way.

   RichEtAl2002_AAMAS.pdf:

C. Rich, N. Lesh, J. Rickel, and A.Garland.  "A plug-in architecture
for generating collaborative agent responses."  In Proc. 1st
Int. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, Bologna,
Italy, July 2002.

This paper gives the background for the classes in edu.wpi.disco.plugin

   LeshRichSidner2001_UM.pdf:

N. Lesh, C. Rich, and C. Sidner. Collaborating with focused and
unfocused users under imperfect communication. In Proc. 9th
Int. Conf. on User Modelling, pages 64–73, Sonthofen, Germany, July
2001.

This paper describes how the focus stack works in discourse
interpretation, especially as related to interruptions.

   LeshRichSidner1999_UM.pdf:

N. Lesh, C. Rich, and C. Sidner. Using plan recognition in
human-computer collaboration. In Proc. 7th Int. Conf. on User
Modelling, pages 23–32, Banff, Canada, June 1999.

This paper describes how the plan recognition algorithm builtin into
CETask works.

   Sidner1994_AAAI.pdf:

C. Sidner. "An Artificial Discourse Language for Collaborative
Negotiation." in Proceedings of the Twelfth National Conference on
Artificial Intelligence, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, Vol 1, pgs.
814-819, 1994.

This paper gives the background for the classes in edu.wpi.disco.lang.

   RichSidner2007_DHelp:
   
C. Rich and C. Sidner.  DiamondHelp: A generic collaborative task
guidance system.  AI Magazine, 28(2), Summer 2007.

This paper describes an menu-based dialogue application built using
Collagen.
